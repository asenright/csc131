Metrics.java Design Principles

/////////Abstract///////////
Metrics is a program which will gather metrics about files. Currently, 
this includes words, lines, and characters of text in the file; 
if it is a code file (c, cpp, h, hpp, java) lines containing comment and 
lines containing source code can also be measured.



////////Implementation: Major Components/////////
Metrics has one subclass, wcFileNode, which contains a reference to the file 
to be measured and the metrics of that file. 

Metrics will have four primary modules: 
(1) PicoCLI to parse command arguments,
(2) a module for populating a list of wcFileNodes, 
(3) a module for gathering metrics of that list, and
(4) a module for outputting the gathered metrics. 
(5) a subclass for holding the data and reference of a specific file.



/////////Runtime Specifications///////////////////
When run, Metrics will create a Metrics object and call it to run. 
The arguments given (-l, -c, -w, -s, -C) determine which metrics are displayed. 
It will run in the order (1)->(2)->(3)->(4) and terminate.
If no files are listed, or if a specified file cannot be found, Metrics
will print out a usage message. 
Metrics' output will look similar to the wc utility in Unix, as follows:
(a) There will be a row labelling columns (Row 0)
(b) Columns' width will intelligently adjust itself as needed based on width of numbers
(c) Rows 1-n will display the data for n items
(d) Rows should be displayed in this order: "lines words chars source comment filename"
(e) If n>1 (more than one file is shown) the final row, row n+1, should show the totals.
